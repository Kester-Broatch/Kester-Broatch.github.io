This project was an inter-university project, sponsored by BAE, which sought for teams to create drone swarms to compete in a capture-the-flag style match. Each team had to build and fly a drone swarm which could go on the offensive by delivering some toy balls to a goal, while also defending against opponents trying to do the same. 

I was responsible for the guidance navigation and control of the drones, which involved a lot of collision avoidance, path planning and swarm-collaboration type tasks. This project was the one which made me passionate about drones and robotics, and gave me a good technical foundation in robotics. 

Unfortunately we never got to finish the project due to covid, but we were able to get a portion of the drone swarm functional as a proof of concept, and were able to compete against two rival teams in our university (see pic above).
