summary: Racing lap time simulator
category: Bachelor's Project

The goal of this project was to develop a racing car simulator which could predict lap times for a given vehicle and track. This allows the racing car design team to find the best vehicle set-ups while in the testing stage, and allow future concept vehicles to be realised.

I completed this project as part of my BEng degree, while working as the head engineer of Glasgow Universities formula racing student team - [UGRacing](https://ugracing.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}. This project involved a huge amount of simulation work, subsystem testing and track validation. The simulator has served as a useful design and learning tool to the team, and is now being developed further in their efforts to develop an electric vehicle.
