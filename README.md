# My personal website

This is the source code for my website https://www.kesterbroatch.com/ which is hosted from github-pages.

It was originally forked from the [ultra](https://github.com/ronv/ultra) jekyll theme.

To test this website locally follow the steps to install jekyll and bundler [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) and build using: 

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
