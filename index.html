  I'm a recent aerospace graduate with an interest in robotics, computer vision, 
  connected cities and beyond. My main experience lies in the aerospace and automotive
  industries, and I have recently started a role as a software and controls engineer at the drone startup 
  <a href="https://www.avy.eu/" target="_blank">Avy</a>. 
  I'm keen for a challenge and love working in small and passionate teams!

  Outside of coding I enjoy getting hands on in the worksphop - I've made a bunch of side projects 
  from rockets, to bikes, to hill climb racing cars. 
  To relax I like to spend time in the countryside either cycling, kayaking or camping :)
